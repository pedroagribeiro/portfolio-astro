      description='Over these five years and I had the opportunity of going from zero software engineering knowledge level to a pretty satisfactory level in which I feel that with given time and effort I can obtain any goal to which I present myself. I had the opportunity to have contact with a whole variety of tools, from a wide array of programming languages to numerous software tools that make the life of software engineers a lot easier. Neverthless, the most important lesson is that an engineer must be ready to learn and defy his methods every day in order to never stop growing.'
